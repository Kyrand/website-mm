I needed a chess-viewer for a larger data-viz project I'm working
on ( [see here]({% post_url 2021-09-01-d3-chess-css3d %}) ) and D3 seemed like the perfect tool for the job. The viewer takes lists of
moves (SAN format) and creates an animated play. It could be a nice base for
something more full-featured. Once again I was impressed by how easy D3 makes
this kind of project.
