Sometimes it's good to imagine something a little exotic
and then try and realize it using the tools to hand. So here we have a simultaneous chess tournament featuring 54 random games from the great Kasparov vs Karpov series of the 80s and 90s. Using D3, THREE.js, CSS3D and a few helpers they are superimposed on a giant rotating cube because, why not?
