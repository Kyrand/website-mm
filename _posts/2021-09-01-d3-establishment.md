This chart shows the findings of a recent commision into
equality in Britain. It found that a small, self-perpetuating elite, attendees
of the ''right'' schools and universities (Eton, Oxbridge etc.) has disproportionate
influence on Britain''s levers of power. From senior judges to the editors of
national newspapers, this group dictates our national discourse and locks out
those not born to privilege.
