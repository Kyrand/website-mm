The phone in your pocket isn''t just recording your
position by satellite and wifi signal (and sending it on to who knows where?),
it also has little accelerometers which monitor the way the phone moves. This
visualization takes data from an academic study, showing that phone users can
be distinguished by their unique walking ''signature''.
