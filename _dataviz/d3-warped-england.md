A D3 maps visualization of the change in the ratio of
English house-prices to household incomes over the period 1997-2012. By warping
the map of England to reflect the increase in this ratio and reciprocal decrease
in households'' house-buying power, we see the dramatic economic disempowerment
of current and future English generations.
