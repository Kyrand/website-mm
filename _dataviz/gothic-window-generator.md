A rainy bank-holiday Monday was a good excuse to try and
indulge my aesthetic whims. Something to overload the frontal cortex with colors
and symmetries, something a little like a Gothic Rose Window in fact. Once one
begins to get D3, rolling this kind of stuff together gets a lot easier and
faster. I liked the effect so much I added the ability to change number of segments
and number of triangular elements in each.
