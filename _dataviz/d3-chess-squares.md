Using the Kasparov-Karpov data-set, this visualisation
shows relative occupation times for each square. The occupation times can be
filtered by type of piece (knight, bishop etc.). Comparing games with Kasparov
playing white with those of Karpov shows a clear difference, reflecting the
different playing styles and strategies of the two.
